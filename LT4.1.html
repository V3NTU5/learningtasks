Some believe romance is Dead,
And would isolate those feelings instead,
All the heartbreak and Rejection that 
they felt,
Is where all that damage was dealt.
            </pre>

            <pre style="font-family: Mynerve;">
Now they would find a way to cope
Just something to give them hope
And honestly who would blame them
It's hard searching for that love that's like a gem
            </pre>

            <pre style="font-family: Teko;">
It takes a bit of time to find that special spark
Where that connection can light up the dark
So, while waiting and finding try and heal
Because that someone will come and be the real deal
            </pre>

            <pre>
Just because you're lonely today
Doesn't mean you have to shy away
Just Enjoy it like it's a normal day
Nothing special and just be on your way
            </pre>
